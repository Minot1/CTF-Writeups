## Challenge

```
We intercepted a photo intended to be received by a suspected agent working with the Zorglaxians - or so it seems.

We're still decompiling the data, but we think the photo was taken nearby to where the agent was supposed to meet the Zorglaxians.

Can you find the location of the photo while our team works on decrypting the accompanying message?

We need the entire street address, city and abbreviated state or district of where it was taken to send our agents to investigate with the local authorities.

# = Number
XX = State abbreviation
All spaces are underscores
flag format: NICC{#_Street_Address_City_XX}
```
And an attachment of an image.

## Solution

I used the image search of Google to find the piece of art in the picture. It is the mural called "Foggy Bottom" and I found a website that gives the exact address of the art.
